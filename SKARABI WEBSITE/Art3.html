							<h1>Security Software Programmer</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic18.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>As expected being a Security Software Developer isn't easy, to become it, you need more experience in two field: The Full Stack development and also on Computer networks, making this mixture between these two areas, isn't something easy to do. I always remember those who always said that we cannot be a System/Network Administrator and a Web Developer in this time, but, as I experienced, the impossible is possible, we can make it through a good understanding of the basics of each one.</p>
							<p>I was confused before but after doing the computer software engineering, where you study everything, I understand that the basics of the internet, or even the Technology is have not everything, but to understand the basics of the protocols, the framework, so that you can work easily and with efficient. I am always a self-learner who seeks to make things more creative and inspirationnal. The fact that you mix between: Cyber security, Computer networks, computer systems and the full stack web development is the best thing that you can do especially when you find yourself that you love what you do and that you are so flexible with all these areas.</p>
							<p>You need determination and a lot of work hard, I really like to work smartly than working hard without understanding what I am doing, when you find yourself that you are in the right track, this is where you can start doing what you have to do and even though, working so hard as much as you can.</p>
							<p>The procrastination should be deleted and the determination should start within you, the fact that you don't have the desire to continue, is almost some of the time, but if it excels you should stop and think about yourself, I used to have these thoughts but I thought why I started before and I took some decisions that can define me, the first thing is to wake up early, this is the time when I can make some tasks that took a long time to achieve, then let my afternoon and night habits as coding and learning, if you are passionate, you're going to win, because deep in you, you know what you are doing in yourself and your life.</p>
							<p>Sometimes, you feel confused to know everything but after some months and years, you are going to find your way and understand that you are stronger that others who are specialized because you know everything but differently, this is why you need to understand all the time, why you started and why you chose this field as a job of your life. The basics are: The full stack web development, computer networks and computer systems, you can add more areas than these ones, because technology is growing and changing, so it's up to you to add or remove one of them. The real basics after all this, is your soft skills, determination as I said and to reprogram yourself the way that you're going to be more flexible and have the best strategy of working.</p>
