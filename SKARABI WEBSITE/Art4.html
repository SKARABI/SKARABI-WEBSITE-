							<h1>My experience with Web Frameworks</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic19.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>My experience with the web frameworks was the best experience, I ever did in my life. If you are a newbie in programming and you know some basics of programming, you can start learning web frameworks. It helps me to understand deeply the programming and the tools that can help me to organize my code and make it simple and minimalist. In the first sight, or the first experience, you are going to get scared about how things are organized and it will be so hard that you cannot know how to start using them. But community, eBooks and the documentation can help to settle this issue.</p>
							<p>After that year, I focused and found the reason why I need to be on this field, I like it because it's always in evolution and I need to be up to date all the time, to be in the right track with technology. I found myself on the lack especially that in two years, I was excellent in Systems and Computer Networks but very weak in Web Development and programming, I thought that I have to continue studying in an other school and to excel in some areas and specialities of Tech, I discovered the web development, where I was knowing only few things about it and it was here the lackness. The third year of my studies was like the hell and I found myself in bad situations especially that I wasn't understanding anything about it. It was hard and I thought to leave again and give up but...</p>
							<p>I thought about what happened to me in the first year of my career and I finally took a decision to start all over again and practice Web development, the forth year was a challenge for me and I needed this year to change some minds that were always against me, against the idea that a girl can code. It was a challenge, I finally succeeded my fourth year with happiness, even if the stress was besides me in the whole year of studying. I ignored everything and everyone and in this fifth year and the final step, not in my life but as a student that go and come from school, I took a long break where I did nothing, until I thought that It was the end of this comfort zone and that I need to move my ass.</p>
							<p>On my fifth year, after resting and feeling the stress that was killing me all the time, I rest 9 months and I decided to break this comfort zone, I decided after using many technologies and understanding the concept of Technology: Systems, Computer Networks, Web Development and Programming, to start my career as a Full Stack Developer, I stopped being a School Student and become a Self-taught who is studying without going to school. The Full Stack is needed even if somehow, it's not something good but I really like to know many things and specify later. I learnt to find my ikigai and start working. I stopped wishing and I took the actions to change my situation. I am able to make it, because I stopped thinking about the giving up. This is my career and I need to break this gender gap forever.</p>
							<p>The last year of study was so confused that I wasn't working as I used to, I became so hopeless of not finding the right path of mine, and this is what makes me stop in a while of doing anything, even if I was always talking to myself to start, I found myself that I was procrastinating everything instead of starting right now.</p>
							<p>I was needing someone who can guide, help me or even more to let me find the way, but no response to what I really want. This is why, one day, I took the decision to become a fearless woman and to go ahead all the circumstances, because sometimes we need to understand our inner voice instead of what people has to say. The decision was taken before graduating and this is the best thing I did in myself, taking the decision to make this path, this job, the job of my life and to never quit whatever the circumstances, the struggles and the hard moments that can come.</p>
							<p>It is not easy to become an IT Full Stack, what does it mean? It simply means to know everything on IT, not especially the Web development or programming, but to be ease in all its field and it's not dedicated to everyone, sometimes you prefer a path and another path is not your concern, whatever your path will be, it's very necessary to know and have a general culture in what you are working on. Being a Full Stack was the first step to become a Security Software Programmer. </p>
							<p>The best advice that I can give you, is to draw your own path and become this person that you always dreamt about, work harder and smarter, be sure that one day, you are going to find what you were seeking about it before, show to yourself and to the world who truly you are and your works will define you, will speak about you. Be original and simple, everything will come in the end.</p>
