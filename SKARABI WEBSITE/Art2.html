							<h1>Things to know before starting an IT career</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic17.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Do you think that Technology is easy to know and to become a professional easily? That's not always the same thing, if you are not willing to spend more time in front of your computer, figuring out the bugs and fixing them, you are not for this job. I am going to share with you with my experience, some truth about this Job and things that you have to start making them before starting your IT career:</p>
							<p>lf you are not willing to stay awake and sleep very late, I really think that this job is not for you, people think about money rather than thinking if they are interested of this job. Yes, you can gain a lot of money with this job but it doesn't mean that you have to do it for this reason, the right reason is that you love creating things, and you are not loving routines.</p>
							<p>Patience is the key to many things and in this field is something compulsory, if you want to succeed and after being passionated about it, you need to be patient while having some bugs and you should determine in each time you want to code if you are self-employed and also have some hobbies that can help you increase your level of patience.</p>
							<p>Reading, you should learn how to read the bugs and the messages of error, instead of taking some advantages like time, when you start reading very well, you can gain more time and reduce the stress level, when I started to learn how to read carefully and with confidence all the bugs and messages that come through, I started to solve problems easily and without difficulties.</p>
							<p>The responsibility of being a person who knows what she is doing in her life, because it's very hard to know everything and the worst is to be in a field that you are not passionate about it, this is why, I thought about the path, what I really want in my life and the right thing is what  I am going to do for the rest of my life, there is no retirement and I don't believe on it, because if you are passionate about something, you have to make it and this is why I choose this field with awareness before anything, I have to assume that it's not easy, I have many messages that come from my job and my attitude is that I am not doing this work like, there is always some messages that are sent in anyway, the first is the gender gap and I assume it, there is always a problem is that, saying that computer science in general, IT globally is dedicated to men and this is the awful thing that anyone could ask for.</p>
							<p>You have to know that the field of Technology is very wide and you have to assume it, when you choose a path, isn't for the enterntainment, but for the creativity, if you don't feel that you are inspired of what you are doing, I suggest you to stop continuing because you are going to waste your time and your life. This field is for those who don't like routine and who want to be creative, the sense of imagination and the logic can signify many things behind. The ability to stay awake for longer and make things with pleasure. I am here to make it happen and I am to focus on what it is very good for me before anything. Before starting, I thought and I assumed my responsibility that I am going to be always up-to-date and that I am going to be more aware of what I am doing. This field is the future of humanity and to become a futurist, you must know why you started.</p>
							<p>If you don't have the envy to start again and have the motivation to carry on in this career, I think you have to stop, as I said, you need patience and to be always up-to-dated, to read more articles, see, check and test some new technologies. It's affordable to be more conscious of what you are doing in this field, because it's not easy and you need some effort to be always talented and have more inspiration. This field needs more creativity, imagination and sense of curiosity. This is the future and it's up to you, to choose which path you highly like.</p>
							<p>The bonus that I can give you is that especially in web development, is that the basics is the same, it's just the code who change, for example all the framework has the same politics and the same process, you just need to know more about the code lines and how to write them in your ide. Same for the computer networks and so on. It's very hard to understand, but when you try and you focus, you are going to find your way, for sure. I love this field, because you've never get bored and you are always discovering something new, testing new tools, new technologies and new protocols, this is something that I am very grateful for, I used to find some troubles but after understanding the basics, I found my way in this path, I am always hungry to know more about it and to nourish my mind about it, this is a job for life where I will never get retired from yet. </p>
